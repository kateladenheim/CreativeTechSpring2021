                <p>Rate My Setup kicked off with a workshop on photogrammetry, which I was a technology I hadn't used much before. I am amazed at how accurate of a process it is — definitely one of the moments when technology has the affect of being magical, or maybe superhuman. The translation of many photographs to t 3d object is a pretty fantastic feat.</p>

                <p>That said, it certainly takes some skill and trial and error to get right. Lighting, distance from the object, camera angle, and more can contribute to the accuracy of the object. The material of the object itself can also impact how 'complete' the final product looks. Shinier or transparent materials don't map as cleanly. I also had trouble with my houseplant. It appears the software maybe had trouble differentiating form the many different leaves in the fern.</p>

                <p>I finally got a more usable object when I was on a walk in my neighborhood. I saw this really wild and unique car, and asked the owners if I could photograph it and turn it into a 3d model for a class. They were an older couple and seemed a little confused about the process, but ultimately agreed as long as I anonymized the plates.</p>

                <p>This model used over 700 photographs and took nearly 20 hours to process from start to finish — but I think it was worth the overnight dense cloud creation.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The car, as an object, also helped me clarify a concept. I started thinking about how they were used and positioned in music videos and pop culture, and how cars end up in long desert roads. I was especialy inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaYvlVR_BEc" target="_blank">Janelle Monae's video for PYNK.</a> I created a Unity scene with desert artifacts downloaded from the Unity Asset Store, as well as some neon signs I found there.</p>

                <img class="diagram-img" src="UnityScene.png"></img>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>The neon elements were animated with a few simple <a href="https://github.com/kateladenheim/MDP-CreativeTech/tree/main/project2-unityscripts">unity scripts:</a> one that made them float up and down in the air; one that allowed them to rotate on their own axis, one that oscillated size, and one that turned the lighting emission on and off to create a blinking light effect.</p>

                <p>The next part was fiddly, to get the framing right. I really wanted it to look like I was sprawling across the hood of the car. I was interested in shaking up the usual orientation in which we see bodies on streaming — as an upright, talking head and shoulders. I hoped that changing this orientation could lead to some more variation in expression and in the dynamics of the scene.</p>

                <p>In order to hide the harsh lines of my apartment scene and to somewhat mask the couch, I did end up keeping the framing at head and shoulders. But the loungey pose still gives the effect that i'm at least leaning over the hood of the car, and fits in somewhat with the flashing lights and pinup vibe of the signage.</p>

                <p>It bears stating that this project was really, *really* fun to create. It was a welcome, maximalist shakeup to dominant zoom square life, and I'm excited about the potential it holds for blending virtual worlds and IRL spaces.</p>
