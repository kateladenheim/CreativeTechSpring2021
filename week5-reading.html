                <p>>>> Assignment: <i>Petri Dish</i> & Chapter 3, <i>Design as the Machines Come to Life</i> from Synthetic Aesthtics</p>

                <p class = "quote">"The petri dish’s ability to culture bacteria and keep out contaminates was thus both old and new: Old because culturing bacteria developed organisms shaped by the entangled conditions of the culture medium surrounding them; new because the promise of the demarcated boundaries of a controlled experiment using a petri dish posited a world where separation between organisms and environment was possible."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I loved this article, and the clever way the author makes the petri dish a microcosm for the battle between relationism and isolationism in culture and in science. I was interested in this quote in particular because of the aesthetic implications of a petri dish — contained, glass walls, sterility, clenliness, containment. It feels like a precursor to airspace-y designs, minimalism, and Marie Kondo-ing your world. The methodologies of science of course do not stay limited inside the walls of a laboratory; they bleed as much as uncontained experiments might.</p>

                <p class = "quote">"If synthetic biology is truly a disruptive technology, then clinging to existing analogies of mechanical and electronic technology may hinder sustainable, ethical, and imaginative design, if that is what we seek."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I'm fascinated by this goal of a drag and drop, cut and paste life creation kit. It feels very Squarespace or Mailchimp, or instagrammable modularity — a direct result of the creation of web and screen based software. It makes me think of the petri dish as well, a separate building block that we can remove and insert where we wish.</p>
                <p class="quote-response">Somewhat tangential, but I also wonder if this goal feeds into a capitalist zero-work or 'effortless' fantasy of production. We can do this, and it's just so easy and user-friendly. Should it be user friendly to manipulate living organisms? Are we seeing the world around us as kin (a la Donna Haraway) if we feel we can bend it to our own will, with a simple, almost thoughless process?</p>

                <p class = "quote">“It is these areas of uncertainty that make synthetic biology's implications more interesting to explore than the much-peddled narratives of world salvation or biological apocalypse, and... make it an interesting partner to art, with its ability to reveal and revel in the flawed.”</p>
                <p class="quote-response">The first thing that struck me about this passage was its description of what art is good at, which is one that really speaks to me and the kind of work I like to create. I think a lot about the line between design and art, which is sometimes superfluous, but I think broadly speaking design proposes, whereas art perhaps wallows, or situates itself within a condition and aesthetically explores the edges of that condition. In thinking about this distinction and about this passage, I'm reminded of the work of Maru Garcia, <a href="https://marugfierro.com/2019/03/29/the-culture/">who in fact has a worked titled "The Culture"</a> that is very much in conversation with both of these readings. This work experiments with interspecies relationships inside of a tank, inviting participation from bacteria, plants, yeast and humans.</p>
