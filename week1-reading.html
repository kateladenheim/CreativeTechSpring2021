                <p class = "quote">"Design systems are especially interesting today, because digital products are systems, and designers who code are no longer confined to the creation of design systems that end up in printed manuals. Code allows designers to not just create designs, but build digital systems that create designs."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">To me this passage brings up questions about digital materiality. It asks the question: What are computers actually good at? What are the qualities of digital products that we can use as materials for design? What qualities are computers bad at, and what flexible tasks require human designers rather than procedural outputs? Computers are extremely adept at executing systems and infrastructure and it is worthwhile as designers to take that materiality into consideration in process.</p>

                <p class = "quote">Just like there is common agreement on the scientific nature of color today, it is also known that the human experience of color is a highly complex and subjective phenomenon. It is generally accepted that it is impossible to create a simple, predictive theory about color harmony – the type of approach that Goethe and Itten believed in. A number of factors determine your response to a specific combination of colors, including gender, age, mood, personal background, and current trends in society."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I can’t help but notice something left out, which is that disability and color blindness also impact people’s ability to see and experience color. Perhaps the only guidelines on color that designers should follow closely are recommendations on visibility/readability for people with disabilities. Beyond a call for equity, I also think this poses an interesting interplay of the tenuous nature color has with hard science and social/perceptive subjectivity, which the author points out is central to color and the challenges in creating codified rules and theories around it.</p>
                <p class="quote-response"><i>Note: the author, in fact, addresses accessibility requirements at length in upcoming chapters!</i></p>

            <div>
                <p class = "quote">"It is important to separate fact from fiction when discussing systematic design principles, and this is especially true for the subject of geometric composition. Rather than beginning a fruitless search for such divine proportions to serve a gross simplification of the world, we will instead focus on a more concrete history of how technology long has inspired designers to use geometric constraints to ease the burden of their work."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I appreciate how this relates back to some of the ideas around color and the complexities within design about what is scientific and what is cultural. One of the most exciting things about design itself is this tension, and how different cultures and schools of thought grapple with it. More specifically to this passage, I’m intrigued by the chicken and egg situation that this brings up: did the technology inspire the design or the design inspire the technology? Did we build things because we had the capability to build them or because we could imagine something alternative and bring it to life? Of course, these are also false dichotomies, but speak to how art, science, and innovation commingle.</p>
