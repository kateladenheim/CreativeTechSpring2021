                <p>Making Spaces went through a fair amount of transformation from initial concept to final presentation. I wanted to represent a space for creating performances (both rehearsing and presenting them) that fights against 'white box paralysis' — a lack of creativity that can be influenced by blank starting points (studios, canvases, etc).</p>

                <p class = "quote">"To some people, this empty room symbolizes something profound, mysterious, and terrifying: the task of starting with nothing and working your way toward creating something whole and beautiful and satisfying. It's no different for a writer rolling a fresh sheet of paper into his typewriter (or more likely firing up the blank screen on his computer), or a painter confronting a virginal canvas, a sculptor staring at a raw chunk of stone, a composer at the piano with his fingers hovering just above the keys. Some people find this moment -- the moment before creativity begins -- so painful that they simply cannot deal with it. They get up and walk away from the computer, the canvas, the keyboard; they take a nap or go shopping or fix lunch or do chores around the house. They procrastinate. In its most extreme form, this terror totally paralyzes people"</p>

                <p>The ideas went from diorama to shelf with petri dishes to museum-like displays of performance ephemera to a screen-based interface with ephemera (including failed attempts at suspending glitter and safety pins in gelatin) to a performance prompt & performance object delivery system via plastic in and out tubes.</p>

                <h3>Project elements that remained constant throughout:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>maintaining the semi-sterile aesthetics of a white box while pushing back against its paralyzing nature</li>
                    <li>a commitment to performance ephemera being, actually, kind of mundane</li>
                    <li>an acknowledgement of building upon the work of others and using their presence and artifacts to re-inspire new creative work</li>

                <p>It's difficult not to be disappointed with something that is meant to represent something large, spacious, and generative, but that is actually *not* that space. I think about what I want this space to actually look and function like: massive, open, airy, with a table and computer in the back left corner and a tube system into vast archives of performance ephemera that can be called upon for inspiration, collected from artists who only 'pay' to participate with an archival offering and a prompt for further generation — a way to keep the wheels turning without being extractive. A way to provide tools for creation that are immaterial but guiding.</p>

                <p>During initial research for this project, I asked a friend what made a perfect making space for their dance practice. They said to me:</p>

                <p class="quote">
                    "My favorite making space was this janky theater room where all of the old props and just truly random shit was kept, and it was the most impractical space aside from the fact that it just had good energy. I hate how...almost overly sanitary (which feels like a sin to say now lmao) some of the studios here are. Feels like they try so hard to be a “blank slate”... especially after this past year having a living archive in a physical space feels sooooo important. Even to just like know that other people have made shit there."
