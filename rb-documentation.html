            <p>In the diagram above, we propose a convoluted system to play a 'song of the day,' taking a user on a journey through some of the data available about that day. We begin by asking them abstractly (via emoji) about their feelings, and then slowly populating the date, weather conditions, popular news stories, and whether or not Mercury is in retrograde. We end by presenting them with an automatically generated Haiku and a song, selected based on data from previous queries.</p>

            <p>To begin building this, we broke our tree into several distinct parts with the plan to link them together in later stages. I did retrograde to poem to song </p>

            <!-- insert code block here to show what I created -->

            <p>I needed to make some concessions - no sylvia platy (subbed another author), spotify API required registration (so I created an array of songs instead).</p>

            <p>I also have experience in front end development so I linked our pathways together, triggering each function at the end and adding some timing delays to make it feel like a series of events, Rube Goldberg style. I also added some styling.</p>
