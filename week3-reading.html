                <p>>>> Assignment: <i>Notes on Failure,</i> Joyce Carol Oates & <a href="https://aiethics.princeton.edu/case-studies/case-study-pdfs/">AI Ethics Case Studies</a></p>

            <div class="quote-container">
                <p class = "quote">"The idea that treatments had occurred without the explicit consent of Charlie’s users eroded trust in the system. In order to restore trust and provide opportunities for true consent, users demanded transparency."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">There's much about this case study that sets off my skepticism antennae — but one thing they fail to mention is that they are engaging communities that have been routinely harmed and manipulated by health systems. A lack of transparency here, given this history, is deeply alienating and undermines any perceived good the "Benevolence Team" might have hoped they were achieving.</p>

            <div>
                <p class = "quote">"In Hedonia, he pointed out, the trading of stolen identities is not explicitly unlawful. This man further alleged that he had been the victim of entrapment by Panoptica law enforcement, as he had not originally intended to sell the identities in his possession. He blamed JEREMY for egging him on and inducing the sale. Transcripts of their conversation show that JEREMY repeatedly offered an increasing amount for the identities possessed by the man."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I thought this scenario was really fascinating — geopolitics is super complicated in digital space where there are not tangible borders. I'm also fascinated by the JEREMY bot's tendency towards entrapment as it moves towards efficiency. It also makes me think about American policing and AI, where using AI in predictive policing actually creates a self-fulfilling prophecy; the more heavily policed neighborhoods are, the more the need for policing is justified. This feels like a similar self-fulfilling loop: would the individuals have committed crimes if the crimes weren't trying to be found?</p>

                <p class = "quote">“Alice's career invalidism deprives her of everything, yet, paradoxically, of nothing. The triumph of the <i>Diary</i> is the triumph of a distinct literary voice, as valuable as the voice of Virginia Woolf's celebrated diaries.”</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I really struggled with <i>Notes on Failure</i> as a whole. While I appreciate the framing that it's necessary to 'fail' in order to bring yourself to the next, higher level of talent, there seems to be some kind of suggestion that creative workers are somehow addicted to strife, to failure, or that they somehow seek out hardship. This feeds into a narrative of suffering artist that I have struggled with my entire professional life. I question if it's empowering or just simply unhealthy to uphold 'the glorious struggle' as necessary, to fesishize or romanticize hardship and the poor conditions under which artists work. </p>
                <p class="quote-response">This is especially potent for me in reading the passage about Alice James and her early death. Is it noble to uphold her poor health as the herald to her incredible work? Is it noble to assert that if she were duly recognized as equals to her brother that she wouldn't have created such fabulous work? Is it noble to assert that her dismissal was rise to her genius? Perhaps she would have been less ill had she been treated better, perhaps her talent would have soared higher if it were regarded and supported. Perhaps failure doesn't need to be framed in terms of death and devastation, illness and depression.</p>
