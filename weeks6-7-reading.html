                <p>>>> Assignment: chapters from "Ruined by Design" by Mike Monteiro</p>

            <div class="quote-container">
                <p class = "quote">"Part of the problem here is the myth of imposter syndrome."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">Imposter syndrome is not a myth- pages on pages of virtuous posturing about how white and male you a few chapters back, and here you are declaring that a social anxiety that disproportionately affects women and people of color is a ‘myth’.</p>
                <p class="quote-response"> I’m here for the general POV of this book and the chapters we’ve been assigned to read. I was also excited to read it — my partner showed me “Fuck you, pay me” before I asked for my first raise and I found it extremely encouraging. I see the essential takeaways as: take responsibility for the things you build, ask meaningful questions, don’t be a thoughtless executor, organize with other workers, work to fully understand the impacts of your work. For this passage specifically, the author is speaking to the need for designers to acknowledge their agency and step into the power they have. These things are incredibly valuable and not always promoted or acknowledged as part of traditional design work. And, a part of me certainly appreciates the no-bullshit directness. But this twitter hot take style writing (ironic, since this guy loves to lampoon twitter, yet clearly benefits from the brevity that platform inspires) also lacks nuance in a deeply frustrating way.</p>

            <div>
                <p class = "quote">"Every problem comes at me as exactly the same size. This is depression taking away a major coping mechanism. That’s exactly how we’ve designed Twitter. Every outrage is the exact same size, whether it was a US president declaring war on a foreign nation or a movie we remember fondly from our childhood being recast with (gasp!) women in the lead roles or an eighteen-year-old who made a stupid decision on what to wear to the prom. On Twitter, those problems become exactly the same size. They receive the same amount of outrage. They’re presented identically. They’re just as big as one another. Twitter works like a giant depressed brain. It can’t tell right from wrong, and it can’t tell big from small. It needs help."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I was a little alarmed by the segue into this passage, but this is an excellent, important point. Jenny O’Dell speaks to this, too in How to Do Nothing — the removal of context is critical to the way we respond to events and the vitriol or obsession or (dis)proportionate attention they receive. The parallels to mental health, and the way our brains and bodies are pressured and affected by this, is also extremely important for designers to consider.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class = "quote">“When you are designing these platforms, you cannot put the onus of enforcing policies on your users. It’s one thing to flag things that fall through the cracks. Things always fall through the cracks. When your entire system for enforcing violation relies on users policing themselves, you’re not doing your job responsibly.”</p>
                <p class="quote-response">This actually reminds me of a project I proposed for a company that shall remain nameless because of NDAs. My teammates and I proposed an idea for a fact-checking browser extension, which we were told would not ever fly at the company because it violates free speech. I was skeptical then about this justification, but my teammates and I were passionate about this idea. We rebuilt it to be a community-driven fact fact checking software, where users could flag phrases in written content for disputed information and provide alternate resources or points of view. Writers and creators could then revise their work with the input of the community.</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I wish I’d read this book before then, because we made and proposed just this — straw-man policies enforced by users. Certainly, I was pressured to be complicit, and didn't stand up to this pressure. To note, the company running this think tank loved our community-driven fact checking plan, even though they certainly have the resources to build a fact-checking software with relative ease.</p>
