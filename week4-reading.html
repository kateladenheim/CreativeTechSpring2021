                <p class = "quote">"Dynamic systems studies usually are not designed to predict what will happen. Rather, they’re designed to explore what would happen, if a number of driving factors unfold in a range of different ways."</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I really appreciate this synthesis of what systems studies are designed to do. I think it's especially interesting to think about in the context of predictive algorithms or AI. Because of the prediction of high level systems, we assume that X will happen and do Y to address or prevent it. Often, these become their own reinforcing loops. Without this key distinction, does the system create the outcome?</p>

                <p class = "quote">"One of the central insights of systems theory, as central as the observation that systems largely cause their own behavior, is that systems with similar feedback structures produce similar dynamic behaviors, even if the outward appearance of these systems is completely dissimilar. "</p>
                <p class="quote-response">Again, a helpful synthesis, especially in comparing the seemingly disparate structures of economic flows and population control. It's helpful to see a unity in between many different life processes and systems that we see as either constructed or organic. Perhaps our economic system would not operate as it does if our live cycles were not modeled as they were.</p>

                <p class = "quote">“We’ll see in a moment that there are ways to damp these oscillations in inventory, but fi rst it’s important to understand why they occur. It isn’t because the car dealer is stupid. It’s because she is struggling to operate in a system in which she doesn’t have, and can’t have, timely information and in which physical delays prevent her actions from having an immediate effect on inventory. ”</p>
                <p class="quote-response">I love this illustration of a behavioral and emotional reponse to operating within a system. It's obvious that the car dealer responding to a system and trying to operate cleanly and efficiently within its models and predictions. It also speaks to the anxiety of not knowing what comes next, even in the most finely tuned systemic models. The car dealer can't know what her customers are going to do, or indeed, any additional circumstances outside of what the model accounts for that can influence consumer behaviors. Predictions are powerful, bu tnot all-powerful. </p>
