        <div>
            <p>Over the past year, I've become increasingly interested in simulated animations. There's a very clear link between this kind of programming and choreography; much of my choreographic work is created via improvised responses to contained conditions. The added, exciting layer with 3d animation is that you can warp and/or ignore physics in embodied simulations.</p>

            <p>To this end, I worked on animations in relation to bodies and containers. One track focused on soft bodies falling in and out of a container, and another focused on the body as a container for moving objects.</p>

                <p>The image at left is the one with the soft bodies falling into the container. Once the soft body looked right falling in, I duplicated it several times and rendered it out. Then, I flipped the bodies and repeated the animation. You can see the sloshing is a little bit faked, but the loop is complete. Given more time, I would have made that loop a little cleaner, and kept the soft bodies a little more floppy on their way out.</p>

                <p>Rather than using Blender's soft body physics simulator, I used cloth physics for these with some fluid pressure inside. This sped up rendering time immensely.</p>

            <p>The two above were my first experiments animating objects with the body as container. In these, the human shape of body is fully recognizable. I was interested in the ways the inside spheres would more dramatically move the body from place to place, and playing with perceptions of tension and control.</p>

            <p>The animation at left used perlin noise effects on the x, y and z axes to randomize the motion of the inner particles. The one at right I keyframed manually, which was more dynamic but caused issues with tearing of the body mesh.</p>

            <p>The two above ended up being my favorite versions. In this case, letting go of the image in my head and embracing the weirder options that the technology allowed was important. Abstracting the body actually led to a more interesting and organic motion pattern, and more interpretive possibilites.</p>

            <p>Both of these use perlin noise to generate the motion of the interior spheres. The video below demonstrates editing these via a noise modifier, and how it changes the animation of the interior objects.</p>
